# 🐍 50 Beginner Python Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to **50 beginner-level Python exercises** designed to build a strong foundation in programming logic, syntax, and problem-solving using Python.

## 📘 Project Overview

The exercises cover essential Python concepts including:
- Variables and data types  
- Strings and string methods  
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
